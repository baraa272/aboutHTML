I joined BTI program that was launched in IUG-Gaza (late 2018) and chosen freelance branch
<br> I learned about basic HTML / CSS / JS and some points about using frameworks like : jQuery,VueJS,Angular...etc , aditionally to important skills for succesful freelancing on famous freelancing sites including (freelancer.com , upwork.com)
<br>
Still I want to join Code Academy because i want to get better on this field from every aspect and to get a future for at least stable income
<br> As all know , I suffer from the bad economic state plus less and less jobs opporunities <br>
Young Men in general have a direction to go freelancing to secure some income, So thats why I hope I can join your Code Academy to get full skills at freelancing and to secure at least a stable job.
